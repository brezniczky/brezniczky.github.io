    <h2>Bio</h2>
</a>
<p>
I'm JÃ¡nos, a software developer currently in London.
I'm into all sorts of things, but they seem to mostly end up in
programming and mathematics. These things are so central in
my areas of interest that they easily happen to be both my hobby
and work.
</p>
<p>
I have recently grown an interest in data science and machine learning techniques.
Actually, it may have started a while ago by now.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> is a nice place to 'learn by doing'
ML, I enjoy spending time with it, may
<a href="http://www.kaggle.com/brezniczky">my results</a>
be varied though (one key factor is, actually having that time to spend..).
I will return to this someday.
</p>
<p>
Here is my <a href="doc-view.html?short">short bio</a>.
</p>
<a class="header-link" href="studies.html"
  title="Want to see some courses I took &amp; some artifacts?">
    <h2>Studies here and there</h2>
</a>
<p>
E.g. on <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>. Whether MOOC will replace
classroom education, not sure, but they are a nice addition, even if only as a
refresher or warm up.
</p>
<p>
<a href="studies.html">Here</a> you can find a few things related to my coursework,
including some certificates.

I hope my <a href="http://evolvingcode.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/trend-check-1-which-programming.html">
    examination of the use of programming languages</a>
will prove useful, especially in the data analytics area.
Ironically, while it was created in R, it - unsurprisingly, points
out that Python appears to be the best first language now.
</p>
<p>In my time I try to get myself to work on some personal projects, as well as deepen my Python experience, and study again just a bit more.
Recently I was also polishing my hands-on NoSQL (particularly MongoDB) experience/knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Other than that, my account is mainly hosting stuff created for online course
activities, which are still
<a href="https://github.com/brezniczky?tab=repositories">here</a>.
